Welcome to GPT&Me, a brand new dev series where I build real apps side-by-side with AI. Live.

In episode 0, I lay out what this project is all about: simple, powerful, well-documented Ruby on Rails apps built with the help of ChatGPT.

We’ll be using:
⚙️ Ruby on Rails (on WSL)
🪣 AWS for image hosting & DNS
🐘 PostgreSQL (migrating from MySQL)
☁️ Heroku for live deployment
💾 Git for version control

Each app connects to the next:
✅ A task manager that evolves into a calendar
✅ A blog system
✅ A photo gallery
✅ A dashboard with integrated goals & metrics

By the end of this series, we’ll have a full ecosystem of productivity apps working together — lightweight, scalable, and AI-assisted every step of the way.

So if you want to learn how to actually build with AI, get inspired, or just watch a dev try not to rage quit… Follow along!
